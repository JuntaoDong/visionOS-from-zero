## WWDC23 visionOS sessions takeaways

### Get started with building apps for spatial computing

- Shared Space: By default, apps launch into the Shared Space. This is where apps exist side-by-side, much like multiple apps on a Mac desktop.
- Three key concepts for a app:
  - Windows: Windows contain traditional views and controls, as well as 3D content.
  - Volumes: Volums allow an app to display 3D content in defined bounds, sharing the space with other apps.
  - Spaces: It's a dedicated full space, where your app's windows, volumes, and 3D objects are the only ones appearing across the view. There are two ways to use a Space:
    - Passthrough mode: Gound content in the real world and keep people connected with their surroundings.
    - Fully-immersive mode: Fill up the entire field of view.

### Priciples of spatial design
- Worth revisiting, many new design concepts comparing to screen-based design.
